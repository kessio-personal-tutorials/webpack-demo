# Asset Management
If you've been following the guides from the start, you will now have a small project that shows "Hello webpack". Now let's try to incorporate some other assets, like images, to see how they can be handled.

Prior to webpack, front-end developers would use tools like grunt and gulp to process these assets and move them from their /src folder into their /dist or /build directory. The same idea was used for JavaScript modules, but tools like webpack will dynamically bundle all dependencies (creating what's known as a dependency graph). This is great because every module now explicitly states its dependencies and we'll avoid bundling modules that aren't in use.

One of the coolest webpack features is that you can also include any other type of file, besides JavaScript, for which there is a loader or built-in Asset Modules support. This means that the same benefits listed above for JavaScript (e.g. explicit dependencies) can be applied to everything used in building a website or web app. Let's start with CSS, as you may already be familiar with that setup.

## Set Up
- Let's make a minor change to our project before we get started:

- dist/index.html
- webpack.config.js
